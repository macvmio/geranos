In a world where data is as vast as oceans, and speed is the essence of success,
there emerges a champion for efficiency and innovation: **Geranos**.
Powered by the robust `go-containerregistry` library,
Geranos is not your ordinary tool. It's a specialized ally in the era of big data,
designed to move mountains—of data, that is.
Specifically, it shines when handling gigantic disk images,
think epic sagas stored on disk, as large as 20GB or more.
Whether you're a digital adventurer transferring VM disk images across the vast expanses of the internet, or a data guardian ensuring your treasure trove of information is safely archived, Geranos is your trusty steed.

## The Tale of Geranos

Imagine the vastness of a digital realm where Alice, a skilled creator of Virtual Machines, crafts a colossal world, a VM disk that spans 200GB. Her creation is brimming with details, yet, much like a universe full of dark matter, not all spaces are filled. This world is a sparse file, expansive yet efficient in its own existence, with 50GB of true essence.

### The Quest Begins: Pushing Boundaries

Alice seeks to share her creation with Bob, a fellow architect in a distant land. She turns to Geranos, a tool known for its cunning and agility. With a few commands, Geranos embarks on a mission, pushing this vast digital world into the OCI-compatible registry, a mystical realm where artifacts can be stored and summoned from anywhere in the digital cosmos.

### The Saga Continues: Pulling from the Void

Bob, intrigued by Alice's creation, uses Geranos to pull this world into his realm. Despite the original size, what travels through the digital ether is not the full 200GB, but merely the 50GB of allocated essence. A marvel of efficiency!

### A Twist in the Tale: Changes Emerge

As all great creations evolve, so does Alice's. She adds a new vista to her digital world, changing its landscape. In a traditional tale, this would require sending the entire world anew. But Geranos is no ordinary tool. It cleverly splits the world into chunks, sending only what has changed—a testament to its wisdom and foresight.

### The Reunion: Smart Merging

Bob, eager to see the new changes, faces no daunting task. His version of the world is already closely intertwined with Alice's original. Instead of starting from scratch, Geranos uses its magic to clone what he has and weaves in the new changes, sparing him time, bandwidth, and space on his mystical device.

## Join the Adventure

Geranos is not just a tool; it's a companion for those who dare to push the boundaries of data transfer, who value speed, efficiency, and the joy of sharing their digital creations.
